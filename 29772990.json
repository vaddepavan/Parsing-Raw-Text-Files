The emphasis here is on understanding CBT theory and the related techniques of intervention, understanding the psychological issues faced by clients, and bringing the two together in formulation. We start by introducing students to the theory of CBT and the process of assessment and formulation and how to structure therapy. Key CBT processes such as guided discovery and collaboration are highlighted. Then students are supported to learn and apply the core skills of CBT including cognitive restructuring, behavioural experiments, problem-solving and relaxation. Finally, these tools and techniques are applied to clients across the age range with cognitive impairment, depression, anger, and anxiety.",

The unit covers a range of material concerns: sculptural, painterly, filmic, performative, durational, conceptual and so on. Themes may change in different years, but include such questions as \"What is contemporary art?\", \"How do we define aesthetics after conceptualism?\" and \"How can art be political today?\" The course also covers institutional concerns, such as methods of dissemination, global reach, biennales, gallery contexts and curatorial implications. With help from teaching staff, students are encouraged to focus the assessment tasks on the concerns of their studio practice or art writing and art history interests.",

In doing so it highlights the unique approaches and contribution of anthropology as a discipline to understanding behaviour.  We will examine various approaches in anthropology to drug use, including the symbolism of drugs, ritual behaviours, economic and political factors influencing the use, production and distribution of drugs and the way in which these processes are enmeshed in local cultures and social networks and the global political economy.  The unit will explore how patterns of drug use as well as dispositions towards use differ across cultural and social borders. Topics include: anthropological approaches to drugs as substances of value, power and desire; ethnomedicine and shamanism, bioprospecting and the trade in herbal medicines;  international traffic in drugs and its relationship to  regional politics and local tribal, peasant and commercial systems of production and exchange; drug  tourism; youth culture and drugs in the West; cultures of intravenous drug use;  the global political economy of pharmaceuticals,  clinical drug trials; antimicrobial resistance, the anthropology of contraceptives, erectile dysfunction drugs; anti-retrovirals in the age of AIDS; Australian and Pacific indigenous drug use; drug trafficking on the internet.",

The unit offers a historical and archaeological framework within which to explore aspects of Greece in the 5th century: from the desperate battles of the Persian Wars to debates about democracy, philosophy, and history. We explore the literary and material culture of Athens at its height -the creation of the Parthenon, the works of Thucydides and Plato, and the evidence of an evolving political system- as well as the seeds of trouble planted within- slavery, unequal status for women and non-citizens, and an increasingly coercive empire. Students will identify ways in which the ideas and archaeology of Athens have shaped the modern world, from the practices of democracy to the Parthenon marbles debate and the development of the modern nation of Greece.",

The unit begins with understanding disturbances, why disturbances need to be controlled and possible responses of various systems to a disturbance. The selection of which variables to control, which variables to manipulate and approaches to interactions are covered, together with the most important types of control loops and computer control systems. Topics include common control scenarios - feed back, feed forward, and cascade systems; ratio control; tuning of PID controllers; single loop and multiple loop systems;  interactions and decoupling; process simulation and advanced process control.",

What about killing non-human animals for food? Like all philosophy units, this unit will also develop critical and analytic thinking skills. These issues are linked to the situation regarding life and death in South Africa and Africa in general, with particular reference to some of the ethical dilemmas (such as violent crime) encountered within this context.",

As well-designed algorithms and data structures are essential for the good performance of an information system, an in-depth understanding of the theoretical properties of algorithms is essential for any computer scientist. As importantly, the theoretical investigation of algorithms leads to a deeper understanding of problem structures and classes of problems and the knowledge of a large variety of algorithm types enables the designer to approach a new problem from different angles. Topics for this unit may include: Computability and Complexity, Automata Theory, Advanced Analysis and Design of Algorithms, Parallel and Distributed Algorithms, Numerical Algorithms, Cryptographic Algorithms, Spatial/geometric Algorithms, Approximation Algorithms and Randomised Algorithms.",

The content can be relatively flexible, but each year faculty will be invited to identify a series of hot-topic articles in their sub-disciplines that can then form the core articles to be used in the unit. Change here is welcome to keep the unit fresh and up-to-date, and working papers could be included. Based on the current honours units, the current hot-topic articles could be relatively evenly split between financial accounting, management accounting, auditing and accounting information systems.",

International law does not operate within a vacuum, nor does it consist of the pro forma application of abstract principles and universals detached from real world conditions. Rather, international public order is best understood as the practical regulation of a global society of state and sub-state actors, subordinate to the trans-national rule of law. International law, therefore, is inseparable from the wider issues of global governance, the mechanisms, institutions and principles that enable the global society to operate as an integrated political and legal system.",

Indigenous knowledge systems and systems based on western scientific tradition have often been seen as the most distant poles on a continuum that ranges from myth to science. Continuing research in Australia shows that Indigenous ecological knowledge on this continent is detailed, localised and grounded in empirical observations. In addition, Indigenous knowledge is embedded within a system of ethics that is oriented toward long-term productivity. It is usual to contrast Indigenous knowledge with non-Indigenous systems of knowledge and care in order to show their divergence or even, in many instances, their oppositions.",

This understanding of genre is developed through three broad approaches to genre as: industrial category-deals with issues of production, including commerce and authorship; textual category, considers plots and structures; critical category, investigates issues of reception, audiences and institutions.",

Students will be able to describe the systemic and total body responses to early/late effects of radiation. Students will undertake a critical review on how the effects of radiation on biological tissue can be utilised in the practice of radiation therapy. Students will acquire an appreciation of the potential hazards present in different radiation therapy procedures, and focus on the principles of dose reduction, while maximising the information produced from a particular dose of ionising or non-ionising radiation. Whilst studying these topics, students will be encouraged to critically reflect, analyse and synthesise relevant information from the literature.",

Based at Monash University's Prato Centre, students will be introduced to the main overarching theories concerning migration and cultural diversity. Within these overarching theories, students will also encounter numerous concepts and perspectives including among others, cosmopolitanism, assimilation, integration, multiculturalism, insider-outsider relations and the notion of 'othering'. Issues relating to race, culture, identity and citizenship will also be considered. The uniqueness of the unit and its relevance to the Prato setting is that students will use these theoretical underpinnings to frame a case study involving observational research to complete 3000 word case study concerning managing cultural diversity in Europe. Students will be encouraged to observe cultural similarities and differences, and particularly the interactions between different cultural groups. The unit aims to provide understandings of managing cultural diversity and a unique experience in undertaking observational research in a European setting. While the topic is a core focus and one of the research strengths in Sociology, it will appeal to students in a range of disciplines including those interested in international relations, law, criminology and Bachelor of Arts students in general.",

                        "synopsis": "This unit provides an introduction to a range of theories of bilingualism and how bilinguals make use of their languages across a range of setting and societies. It explores these issues from a range of perspectives, such as different types and degrees of bilingualism, the different roles played by each language in bilingual societies, the properties of bilingual speech, the bilingual brain and educational and other social policy for bilingualism. A key interest is also the ways in which theoretical stances inform our understanding of bilingualism and social policy, and the ways in which research into bilingualism can help inform wider theories of language acquisition, processing and use.",

Students undertaking the course are introduced to archives and manuscripts, visual culture and urban landscapes. In particular, when possible this unit will draw on the resources of the Archivio di Stato of Prato, and the 'Archivio Datini Online' making maximal use of the digitized documents available through this portal. Texts will be read from a variety of historiographical perspectives, and considered within the appropriate historical contexts. Participants will generally have the opportunity to engage with some of the foremost scholars in this area of study. Students therefore will be expected to attend, and critique, workshops and lectures organized to coincide with their intensive week's study. There will be a compulsory seminar for all participating in the unit in advance of departure for Italy. While this unit is designed for fourth level students, qualified third year students may enrol with permission of the unit coordinator.",

With regard to intentionalism, the focus will not only be on the standard arguments for and against intentionalism, but also on the deeper theoretical commitments of intentionalism.  For example, intentionalism presupposes that there is a defensible notion of legislative intent.  Students will consider not only classic (aggregative) theories of legislative intent, and the criticisms of those theories, but also contemporary (largely non-aggregative) theories.  Students will also consider the current scepticism among judges on the High Court of Australia towards the concept of legislative intent.  Similarly, with regard to textualism, consideration will be given not only to the standard arguments for and against textualism, but also to different versions of textualism based on different accounts of the meaning of a legal text.  Consideration will also be given to Andrei Marmor's recent argument that, while textualism provides an accurate account of the meaning of statutory texts, few appellate court cases involving statutory interpretation turn on a correct understanding of the meaning of the relevant statutory text.",

What do managers do, and how do I become a good manager? What are the effects of management practice on employees and their experience of being managed? Key contemporary issues of globalisation and cultural diversity, ethics and social responsibility affect the answers to these questions and are therefore woven throughout the curriculum. The unit draws upon a range of sources - academic, practical, popular cultural - to engage students in multiple ways of knowing about management.",

The ecological dimensions of space and time will be a common theme running through the unit as we explore the ecology of fitness, interaction networks and the four 'M's - metacommunity ecology, metasystems, metabolic ecology and macroecology. Underpinning all of this will be the recognition of the interplay between ecology and evolution that is blurring the distinction between the two disciplines. Each topic and its core concepts will be covered in lectures and the relevance of these topics to the changing world and to conservation will be discussed. Material presented in lectures will be supported by practical and tutorial sessions. Together we will read and interpret 'hot off the press' ecology research papers, debate controversial topics in the field, delve into live data and design experiments to answer unsolved problems.",

How did the Bolshevik ascent to power reshape the private sphere? How did the Communist authorities try to create the New Soviet Man and Woman and forge a new, Soviet national identity? What relevance do these efforts have for understanding today's post-Cold War Eastern European politics? Through literature, films, memoir, and other primary sources, students will study and analyse the impact of politics on popular culture, work, family life, education, humour, and gender relations. Readings, lectures, and tutorial discussions will explore the degree to which individuals carved out private spaces at home, at work, and in social circles to limit the impact of politics on private life. The unit will begin with a background on Russian politics and culture before the establishment of Communist governments and will end with an examination of the USSR's collapse and its aftermath. Discussions of primary sources in tutorials will provide students with the skills to analyse similar primary sources in their written work.",

Students will explore the political foundations of public health policy in Australia including the impact of public health policies and will develop skills in policy analysis and public health advocacy. This unit will provide students with the foundations knowledge in preparation for the development of skills of the practice of public health nutrition. The key theme explored in this unit is Theme 2: Determinants and influences on population health and nutrition coupled with partial integration of content from Theme 4: Food: from science to systems.",

Beginning with the rationalists, the course explores the thought of Ibn Rushd, Maimonides and Thomas Aquinas, before moving to a comparative examination of various mystics, such as - Bernard of Clairvaux, Bonaventure, the Zohar, Meister Eckhart, Ibn al-Arabi and Rumi.",

Initially, the course will explore traditional theoretical constructions of nationalism before considering the contemporary reconfiguring of nationalism. This reconfiguring will be performed in relation to discourses such as policy arrangements in relation to political machinations, auteur constructions, traditions of landscape cinema, race relations, multiculturalism, beach culture, the social, globalism, marketing, distribution, gender and criticism. The unit will employ feature, documentary and short film and television examples as well as contemporary and archival audio-visual texts.",

By cultural economy we include the broad range of cultural/creative industries, arts and traditional cultural practices and products, handicraft and forms of manufacture. We explicitly situate these as economic practices embedded in wider social and cultural contexts. Through our interdisciplinary and practice-based approach, we examine how cultural economies might be used to provide employment, strengthen identity and resilience and point to more sustainable, less volatile and dependent growth for developing countries. Through lectures, case studies and workshops, students are encouraged to bring their own experiences to bear on this emerging field of development.",

This unit builds upon the scientific concept of disease aetiology explored in Integrated Science Systems (BND2103) and the critical interpretation of scientific literature and research skills developed in years 1 and 2. Learners will explore the epidemiology of the major nutrition related diseases, their causal pathways and population based recommendation for prevention. The rationale for the application of dietary modifications for patients with specific disease states and the means of evaluating dietary treatment is explored. Nutrition related emerging issues in disease aetiology and management are also explored and the emphasis on the important role of genetic susceptibility in nutrition science is continued.",

The European Union is commonly seen to have been an antidote to war, ushering in an era of Kantian peace; a view powerfully endorsed by the awarding of the Nobel Prize to the EU in 2012. Despite the strength of this view, recent research suggests it is possible to look at the relationship between peace and European unity differently. In fact, European unity has been propelled by war since 1945: not just at the founding moment at the end of the Second World War (NATO, EEC, WEU), but by anti-colonial nationalists pushing European powers towards pro-active European policies, and in EU responses to the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia (OSCE, CFSP), Iraq, Libya and the challenges posed by refugee movements and global terrorism. An unintended consequence of the logic of deeper integration has been the consolidation of a European identity amongst some elites, whilst political and popular support for the EU has weakened. This last development poses serious questions about the future shape the state system in what remains a major player in regimes of global governance and security.",

We examine the concept of need in relation to populations and take a practical approach to the process of assessing the mental health needs of populations and groups. Two major community intervention strategies to address mental health needs are examined. The role of consumer participation and collaboration and the notion of citizenship are explored in some detail.

The unit adopts a global perspective but looks at issues through a South African and African lens. We examine questions such as: When, if ever, is killing justified? Many of us think that killing is permissible in emergency rescue situations, or in self-defence. Is it possible to explain this in a way that is consistent with our more typical attitudes to killing? What about killing non-human animals for food? Like all philosophy units, this unit will also develop critical and analytic thinking skills. These issues are linked to the situation regarding life and death in South Africa and Africa in general, with particular reference to some of the ethical dilemmas (such as violent crime) encountered within this context.",

Students will be expected to produce multi-media packages across a mix of text, image, video and audio, with some collaboration required. The aim is to build skills that are essential in a modern commercial newsroom and that are expected of young reporters. Journalists are expected to be able to come up with ideas of their own, expressed as a developed idea with an angle and a clear course of implementation. They should also be able to pick up an editor's idea and follow it through to completion - making sure the finished work has images and other supportive material to make it publishable. They should be able to work with a more experienced editor to turn their story into something publishable, if necessary.",
